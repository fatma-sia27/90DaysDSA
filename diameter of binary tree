Ques:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Code:
class Solution {
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        int[] diameter=new int[1];
        height(root, diameter);
        return diameter[0];
    }
    
    public int height(TreeNode root, int[] diameter) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int lh=height(root.left, diameter);
        int rh=height(root.right, diameter);
        diameter[0]=Math.max(diameter[0],lh+rh);
        return 1+Math.max(lh,rh);
    }
}
