Tree Terminology
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are connected by edges. A tree has the following properties:

The tree has one node called root. The tree originates from this, and hence it does not have any parent.
Each node has one parent only but can have multiple children.
Each node is connected to its children via edge.

Types of Trees
Types of trees depend on the number of children a node has. There are two major tree types:

General Tree: A tree in which there is no restriction on the number of children a node has, is called a General tree. Examples are Family tree, Folder Structure.

Binary Tree: In a Binary tree, every node can have at most 2 children, left and right.  In diagram below, B & D are left children and  C, E & F are right children.
