Ques1: Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

      Example 1:

      Input:
      N = 10
      Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
      
      Your Task:
      This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it       will be added by the driver code.
      
      Code:
      class Solution
      {
    
          public void printNos(int N)
      {
        //Your code here
        
       if(N<=0){
            return; 
        }
        printNos(N-1);
        System.out.print(N+" ");
     }
    
  }
  
  
 Ques2: You are given an integer N. Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

      Example 1:

     Input:
     N = 5
     Output:
     1 2 3 4 5
     Explanation:
     We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.
     
     Your Task:  
     You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function printTillN() which takes an integer N as an input parameter and print numbers from 1 to N space-          separated integers without the help of loops.
     Note: print newline character at the end.
     
     Code:
     class Solution{
    static void printTillN(int N){
        // code here
        if(N<=0){
           return; 
        }
        printTillN(N-1);
        System.out.print(N+" ");
    }
}
